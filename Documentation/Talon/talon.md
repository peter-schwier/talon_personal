# Talon (Voice Control)

Voice control system
* with a free speech recognition engine
* scriptable with an embedded Python 3

## Getting Started

1.  Download and install [[Talon]] for your operating system.
    
2.  Run the [[Talon]] app.
    
3.  Open the [[Talon Home]] directory. This is `%APPDATA%\Talon` on Windows, and `~/.talon` on macOS/Linux. (Talon has a menu in your system tray near the clock, you can use `Scripting -> Open ~/.talon` as a shortcut open Talon Home).
    

3.  Add some [[dot talon]] and [[dot python]] scripts to `~/.talon/user` to add voice commands and other behaviour to Talon. Your user scripts control all of the voice commands in Talon, so Talon won’t recognize any commands until you add some scripts.
    
4.  Install Conformer using Talon’s Speech Recognition menu.
    
5.  Go to `Scripting -> View Log` in the menu for debug output, or `Scripting -> Open REPL` for a Python command line.
